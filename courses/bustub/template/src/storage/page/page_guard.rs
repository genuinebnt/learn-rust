//! Port of `src/storage/page/page_guard.cpp` (BusTub, MIT, Copyright (c) 2015-2025 Carnegie Mellon University Database Group).
//!
//! A page guard is an RAII handle on a page in the buffer pool. While it exists the page is **pinned** (it can't be evicted) and
//! **latched** (shared for a `ReadPageGuard`, exclusive for a `WritePageGuard`). When it is dropped, in that order, the page is
//! unlatched and then unpinned, so a caller can't forget either, even on an early `return`, `?` or panic.
//!
//! The pool makes guards; what a guard holds inside is yours. The tests use only the methods in this file.
