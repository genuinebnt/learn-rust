//! The review schedule, as pure functions. See docs/SPACED_REPETITION.md for the reasoning and the measurements.
//!
//! **The memory model is FSRS-6**, from the open-spaced-repetition project's official `fsrs` crate: the scheduler modern
//! Anki uses, fitted to hundreds of millions of reviews. Every problem has a stability (how many days until recall
//! drops to 90 %) and a difficulty; recall probability at any time is `retrievability`. Grading a review as
//! again / hard / good / easy updates both, and the model sets the next interval for the desired retention.
//!
//! **On top of it, the parts that fit this owner's routine** (all tested):
//! - every weekday has a capacity (how many reviews that day can take); due dates snap to days with room,
//!   preferring the day closest to the ideal one, a little early over late, and the lightest one;
//! - a problem's first review goes to the consolidation day (Sunday): the week's new problems are reviewed together;
//! - the plan for a day takes the most-forgotten problems first, up to that day's capacity ([`pick`]).
