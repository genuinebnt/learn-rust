title: Latch crabbing and safe nodes
summary: How readers and writers walk a tree hand over hand, why a latch on a child lets you release the parent, what makes a node safe for an insert or a remove, and why top-down ordering cannot deadlock.

A B+ tree used by many threads at once has to answer two questions: *how do two operations avoid corrupting a page*, and *how do they avoid blocking each other more than necessary*. The answer to the first is latches (reader-writer locks on pages). The answer to the second is **latch crabbing**: hold as few latches, for as short a time, as correctness allows. It is named after how a crab walks: one leg moves, the others stay planted.

## Readers: hand over hand

A reader needs a page only until it has found the next one. So: latch the child, **then** release the parent.

```text
latch(header, read)
latch(root, read);  release(header)
while node is internal:
    child = route(node, key)
    latch(child, read);  release(node)      ← the child first, then the parent
node is the leaf: read it, release it
```

Why the child before the parent? If you released the parent first, a writer could split or merge the child away before you latch it, and you would walk into a page that no longer holds your key's range. A reader never holds more than two latches, and never holds a parent while waiting more than one hop below.

## Writers: keep the path, until it is safe

A writer that changes a leaf may have to change the leaf's parent (a split adds a separator; a merge removes one), and that parent's parent, and so on. So a pessimistic writer takes **write** latches top-down and keeps them all. That is correct and slow: the root is exclusively latched by every writer. The improvement is to notice that a node is often **safe**: the operation cannot propagate above it.

| operation | a node is **safe** when | so, once you hold it, you may release |
|---|---|---|
| insert | adding one entry cannot make it split: leaf `size + 1 < max`, internal `size < max` | everything above it |
| remove | taking one entry cannot make it underflow: `size > min` | everything above it |
| remove at the root | a root leaf with `size > 1`; a root internal page with `size > 2` | the header |

caption: A writer inserting a key descends three levels. The root is not safe (full), so the writer holds it and the header. The middle page is safe (has room): once it is latched, the header and the root are released. The leaf is latched next; only the middle page and the leaf remain held, however tall the tree is.

</svg>
```

For an insert into a tree of 681-way pages almost every node is safe, so a writer holds the leaf and, momentarily, its parent. Writers to different leaves no longer wait for each other.

## Why it cannot deadlock

A deadlock needs a cycle of threads each holding a latch another wants. Crabbing prevents cycles by an **ordering rule**: latches are taken **top-down**, and among siblings **left to right**. A thread holding page P waits only for pages *below* P or to its *right*; it never waits for an ancestor or a left neighbour. A chain of "waits for" edges can only point down or right, so it can never come back to its start.

> [!WARNING] The rules that make it true
> Never take a latch on a page above, or to the left of, one you hold. Never wait for a latch while holding something a thread you would be waiting for might need *above* you. An iterator that holds a leaf and then latches its left neighbour breaks the rule; that is why the iterator in this course holds nothing between steps.

## C++ comparison

| C / C++ | Rust |
|---|---|
| `std::shared_mutex`, `lock_shared()` / `unlock_shared()` by hand | `RwLock`: `read()`/`write()` return guards that unlock when dropped |
| `std::shared_lock` / `unique_lock` scoped objects | the same guards; storing them in a `Vec` is storing locks |
| releasing "the parent" = calling `unlock` on a saved pointer | `drop(guard)`, `guard = child_guard`, or `vec.clear()` |
| lock hierarchy checked by convention or a tool (TSan's deadlock detector) | convention, plus tests with a watchdog |

## In real code

### Using it: the rules as functions, and hand-over-hand locking with real `RwLock`s

    fn safe_to_insert(&self) -> bool { if self.is_leaf { self.size + 1 < self.max } else { self.size < self.max } }
    fn safe_to_remove(&self) -> bool {
        match (self.is_root, self.is_leaf) {
            (true, true) => self.size > 1,
            (true, false) => self.size > 2,
            (false, _) => self.size > self.min(),
        }
    }
}

### In the exercises

- **2c-02:** `find_leaf` is `contains`'s loop: `guard = self.bpm.read_page(child)` latches the child, then drops the parent.
- **2c-03:** the pessimistic write path keeps every guard on a stack (`ctx.write_set`): `latches_held` with no safe pages.
- **2c-09:** `safe_to_insert` and `safe_to_remove` are the first test's functions; `release_ancestors()` is `held = 0`; the second test of the stage ("does not wait for a reader on the root") is the last test above on a real tree.
- **2c-10 (boss):** the concurrent tests are the first concurrency test above, with a deadlock watchdog.

### Where it is used

- **PostgreSQL's nbtree** uses Lehman and Yao's B-link tree: each page has a right-link, so a reader that lands in a page that has just split can follow it, and no parent latch is needed while descending; BusTub's course uses the textbook crabbing variant.
- **InnoDB** takes index-tree latches in modes (S, SX, X) and releases ancestors on "optimistic" descents that assume no structure change, the same two ideas.
- **Concurrent maps**: `dashmap`'s shard locks, `BTreeMap` under an `RwLock` (coarse), and lock-free skip lists (Java's `ConcurrentSkipListMap`) are points on the same spectrum.
- **Linked structures with fine-grained locks**: hand-over-hand ("lock coupling") traversal of a list or a tree is the standard way to keep each lock short.
