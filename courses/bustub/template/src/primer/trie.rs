//! Port of `src/include/primer/trie.h` and `src/primer/trie.cpp`: a **persistent** (copy-on-write) trie that maps strings to values of
//! any type. `put` and `remove` never change a trie: they return a new one that shares every node they did not have to touch with the
//! old one, so old versions stay valid and cost almost nothing to keep.
