//! Port of `src/container/disk/hash/disk_extendible_hash_table.cpp`: an extendible hash table whose header, directories and buckets
//! are pages in the buffer pool. Three levels: the header maps the top bits of a hash to a directory; a directory maps the low
//! bits to a bucket; a bucket holds a few pairs. A full bucket splits (and the directory doubles if the bucket was already
//! as deep as the directory); an empty one merges with its split image (and the directory halves if it can).
//!
//! Latching is by guards, top down, releasing a parent once the child is known to be safe ("latch crabbing"):
//! `get_value` read-latches header -> directory -> bucket; `insert` and `remove` write-latch them.
