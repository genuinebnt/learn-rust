//! Port of `src/include/concurrency/watermark.h` and `src/concurrency/watermark.cpp`: the **watermark** is the smallest read timestamp of
//! the running transactions (or the latest commit timestamp when none runs). No transaction can ever need a version older than the
//! newest version at or below the watermark, so everything older is garbage.
