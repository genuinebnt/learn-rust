**Where this fits.** The watermark, the transaction manager, the version chains and the snapshot scan work one at a time. This stage runs them **together**, the way module 4b's executors will: a random session in which transactions begin, insert rows, write rows (the first write adds an undo log with `generate_new_undo_log`, later writes fold into it with `generate_updated_undo_log`, the tuple is updated in place and its undo link replaced) and commit, while a plain Rust model records which version of every row is committed at which timestamp. Then every transaction scans with SQL and must see exactly what the model says. Plus BusTub's own timestamp, reconstruction, collection and scan tests.

> [!CHECK] A session leaves one transaction running with a pending change to a row, another that began earlier, and a third that began later. For each, say which version of that row they should see, and what the table and the undo log hold. If the early transaction disagrees with the model on this row only, which of your four functions would you suspect first, and what is the smallest session that shows it?
> ||The writer sees its own pending version (the table's tuple stamped with its temporary timestamp); the early and the late transaction see the last committed version at their own read timestamps: the early one rebuilds it from the chain if a commit happened after its begin, the late one reads the committed version straight from the log chain below the pending one (collect skips the uncommitted table version because its timestamp is neither ≤ read_ts nor theirs). Suspect `collect_undo_logs` first (visibility of the uncommitted base and the chain walk), then `generate_new_undo_log` (the timestamp it records: that of the version it replaces, not of the new one). The smallest session: begin A, begin B, A writes a row, A commits, B scans.||

## The task

Nothing new to write. Make `cargo test --test stages_4a s4a_06` pass:

- the **session property**: random sessions of begin, insert, write (update or delete) and commit, with a model of the committed versions and pending writes; every transaction that is still open (and each one just before it commits) scans and must see the model's snapshot; a transaction that begins at the end sees the latest committed state.
- **BusTub's tests**, ported: `txn_timestamp_test` (timestamp tracking, `TimestampTracking`), `tuple_reconstruct`, `collect_undo_log_test`, `generate_undo_log_test` and `scan_test` (the four steps of the project's tests, using the same table and values).

## Your freedom

None new: a failure belongs to one of your four functions or the manager.

## The Rust toolbox

**Dumping the state.** `txn_mgr_dbg(info, txn_mgr, table_info, table_heap)` (in `execution_common`, given) prints every tuple of the table with its version chain and the logs: the quickest way to see what a session did. The failing property prints the session steps; replay them by hand with the helper.

**Shrinking.** Proptest cuts a failing session down to a handful of steps: read them in order and draw the table and the chain after each.

## If this is new

- Everything is in the earlier stages of this module.

## Tests

- The session property (open transactions, committing transactions, a fresh transaction).
- BusTub's five ported tests.

## Hints

### Start from the smallest failing session

The shrunk steps are usually three or four: `Begin, Insert, Commit, Begin, Write...`. Reproduce them in a `#[test]` of your own and print the chain after each step.

### The commit stamps what the write set holds

If a committed row is invisible to later transactions, check that every written rid was added to the write set (the test does `append_write_set`, as the executor will).

## Performance

Sessions are short; the property runs in under a second. The BusTub tests are small as well.

## Experiment

Optional. Predict first, then run.

1. **Forget the write set.** Skip `append_write_set` in the session. What do the readers see and which function would you blame?
2. **Longer sessions.** Raise the step count to 200. Does anything new fail?

## Other designs

None for this stage. The *Other designs* sections of 4a-01 to 4a-05 list the alternatives to compare with yours.

## In BusTub

Project 4 of the 2025 course: `watermark.cpp`, `transaction_manager.cpp` (`Begin`, `Commit`, `Abort`), `execution_common.cpp` (`ReconstructTuple`, `CollectUndoLogs`, `GenerateNewUndoLog`, `GenerateUpdatedUndoLog`) and the transactional path of `seq_scan_executor.cpp`. BusTub's MVCC keeps the newest version in the table and the older ones as **undo logs**, each a delta that turns a version into the previous one, chained from the tuple.

## The C/C++ way

| C / C++ | Rust |
|---|---|
| `./bin/bustub-txn_timestamp_test` and `bustub-txn_scan_test` | `cargo test --test stages_4a s4a_06` |
| `TxnMgrDbg(...)` | `txn_mgr_dbg(...)` |

**Port rule:** BusTub's gtest cases are ordinary `#[test]` functions.
