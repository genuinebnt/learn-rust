//! Port of `src/storage/disk/disk_manager.cpp` (BusTub, MIT, Copyright (c) 2015-2025 Carnegie Mellon University
//! Database Group).
//!
//! The disk manager reads and writes pages to and from a file, and a log to a second file. Pages are named by
//! `PageId`; where a page lives in the file is the disk manager's own business. Everything about the layout, the
//! bookkeeping and the locking is yours to design: the tests only use the public methods in this file.

// TODO(1a-01): your private types and helper functions go here. Nothing in this file is prescribed except the public
// methods below; the tests call only those.

/// shared between threads, so whatever mutable state you keep must be protected (a `Mutex` is the usual way).
