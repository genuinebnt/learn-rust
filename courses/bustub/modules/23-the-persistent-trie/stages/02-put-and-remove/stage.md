A persistent trie never changes: `put` and `remove` return **a new trie** that shares every node it did not have to touch with the old one. The old trie stays valid and costs almost nothing to keep: that is what lets readers and a writer work at the same time in stage 3. `put` creates new nodes only along the path from the root to the key. `remove` does the same and has a second job: a node left with no value and no children is useless and is **pruned**, and so is its parent if that now leads nowhere either. If the whole trie becomes empty it has **no root**.

> [!CHECK] A trie holds the keys "ab" and "ac". You `put` "ad". Which nodes of the new trie are new, which are shared with the old one, and what does the old trie still contain? Then `remove` "ab" from the new trie: which nodes are new, and what happens to the node for "b"? What if you remove "ad" and "ac" as well?
> ||After `put`: the root and the node for "a" are copies (the path to the change), plus a new node for "d"; the nodes for "ab" and "ac" are shared with the old trie, which is unchanged. After removing "ab": the root and "a" are new again, the node for "b" is **gone** (no value, no children), "c" and "d" are shared. Remove "ad" and "ac" too and the "a" node and then the root are pruned: the trie has no root.||

## The task

In `src/primer/trie.rs`: `Trie::put::<T>(&self, key, value: T) -> Trie`. The recursive helper `put_at(node, key, value)` is part of the region: given the old node at this position (if any) and the rest of the key, it returns the new node:

- start from a **clone** of the old node (its children map clones the child `Arc`s, not the subtrees) or from an empty node if there is none;
- if the key is used up, set `value` on the clone (replacing what was there, whatever its type);
- otherwise replace the clone's child for the next character by the result of the recursive call on the old child;
- wrap the result in `Arc::new`.

The empty key puts the value in the root.

In `src/primer/trie.rs`: `Trie::remove(&self, key) -> Trie`, with the helper `remove_at(node, key) -> Removal` in the same region. `Removal` is `Missing` (no value under the key: the answer is the old trie, unchanged) or `Replaced(Option<Arc<TrieNode>>)` (the node that takes this position: `None` if nothing is left of it). For each node on the path: clone it, recurse into the child (or clear the value at the end of the key), then put the replacement child back, drop the child if it became `None`, and return `None` yourself if you now have no value and no children.

The tests: exact scenarios (put builds one node per character; replaces a value even with another type; keys that are prefixes share a path; putting never changes the old trie; only the path is copied and everything else is shared; values need not be clonable; remove deletes only the given key; removing everything leaves a trie with no root; empty nodes are pruned; a node that still leads somewhere stays; removing a missing key changes nothing; removing never changes the old trie), and a property: **random puts and removes, keeping every version**: at each step the new version equals a map, every older version still equals the map it was, the new version shares with the old one every child off the key's path, no empty branch is left behind, and a trie has a root exactly when it holds a key.

## Your freedom

How you copy the path (recursion with a helper, an explicit stack of nodes, rebuilding from the bottom) and how `remove` reports a missing key (an enum, an `Option`, a flag); the contract is the shape of the result, not the helper.

## The Rust toolbox

**`Arc::new` and clone for copy-on-write.** `let mut copy = (**node).clone();` clones the node's children map: it copies the child *pointers* (`Arc`s), not the subtrees, so the copy is cheap and shares everything below.

**Recursion that returns the new node.** `fn put_at(old: Option<&Arc<TrieNode>>, key: &[char], value: Value) -> Arc<TrieNode>`: build the copy, replace one child by the recursive result, wrap in `Arc::new`.

**An enum for 'nothing to do'.** `enum Removal { Missing, Replaced(Option<Arc<TrieNode>>) }` lets the helper say 'the key was not here, keep the old trie', 'this node is the new node' or 'nothing is left of this node'.

**`split_first`.** `match key.split_first() { None => .., Some((c, rest)) => .. }` takes a slice apart without indexing.

**Type erasure on the way in.** `let value: Value = Arc::new(value);` turns any `T: Any + Send + Sync` into the shared erased value once, before the recursion.

```rust
let mut new = node.map(|n| (**n).clone()).unwrap_or_default();   // clone the node inside the Arc
match key.split_first() { None => ..., Some((c, rest)) => ... }
new.children.insert(*c, child);                                  // replace one child pointer
Arc::new(new)
```

```rust
enum Removal { Missing, Replaced(Option<Arc<TrieNode>>) }
match Self::remove_at(child, rest) {
    Removal::Missing => return Removal::Missing,
    Removal::Replaced(Some(c)) => { new.children.insert(*c_char, c); }
    Removal::Replaced(None) => { new.children.remove(c_char); }
}
```

## Design notes

**Why the value is not copied.** The value sits behind its own `Arc`; cloning a node copies the pointer. That is why `put::<T>` works for a `T` that cannot be cloned at all (a `Box` of a type with no `Clone`): the value is moved into the `Arc` once and shared from then on.

**What gets copied.** On the path: one clone per node, each copying that node's child table (pointers). Everything hanging off the path is untouched. For a 10-character key in a trie of a million keys, a `put` allocates 11 nodes.

**Shared means immutable.** `Arc<TrieNode>` gives only `&TrieNode`: there is no way to change a shared node by mistake. This is the property C++ asks you to keep by never removing `const`.

**Why a result type.** Two different "nothing" answers must not be confused: *the key was not there* (keep the whole old trie, all pointers shared) and *the subtree is now empty* (the parent must forget it). Returning `None` for both would make the parent either copy a path for nothing or keep an empty node.

**Pruning is why the tests look at `root()`.** After `remove("te")` of the last key the root must be `None`, not an empty node: BusTub's `RemoveFreeTest` asserts exactly this.

**A value node with children stays.** Removing `te` from `{te, tes, test}` clears the value but the node still has a child; pruning stops there.

## If this is new

- [S7 Smart pointers & interior mutability](/t/s7-smart-pointers): `Arc`, clone-on-write, sharing.
- [L7 Enums & pattern matching](/t/l7-enums-patterns): a small enum for a helper's three outcomes.
- [L4 Traits & dispatch](/t/l4-traits-dispatch): `Any`, `Send + Sync` bounds.
- [Y5 Testing & verification](/t/y5-testing-verification): keeping every version and checking all of them at the end.
- The optional *persistent data structures and path copying* concept.
- [L1 Ownership & moves](/t/l1-ownership-moves): Clones & drops: sharing structure instead of copying: a clone of a node clones pointers.

## Tests

- Put: path, replacement, prefixes, persistence, sharing, non-clonable values.
- Remove: single keys, an emptied trie, pruning, a missing key, persistence.
- Property: every version of a long random history stays what it was; sharing; pruning; the root exists exactly when there is a key.

## Hints

### Recurse on the old child, not on the new node

The clone already has the child pointers; look the child up in the **old** node (`node.children.get(c)`) and replace it with the recursive result.

### An absent node is just an empty node

For a key that extends beyond the existing trie, `put_at(None, rest, value)` builds a fresh chain; there is no separate "create" code path.

### Check sharing in your own test

`Arc::ptr_eq(&old.children[&'x'], &new.children[&'x'])` must hold for every branch off the path.

### Report 'missing' before copying

If the key is not stored, return `Missing` as soon as the walk fails or the last node has no value, so that the caller keeps the old pointer.

### Decide pruning at the end of each level

After updating the clone's children and value, a node with `value.is_none() && children.is_empty()` is gone: return `Replaced(None)`.

### The root is just another node

The same helper handles the root; a trie whose root is pruned is `Trie::from_root(None)`.

## Performance

`put` is `O(len(key) × fan-out)` time and allocates `len(key) + 1` nodes, each the size of its child table. Old versions cost nothing extra: sharing means a million snapshots of one trie are a million root pointers plus the paths that changed.

**Measure it.** Put 23 333 keys one by one and keep every version: it takes about 15 ms in release mode, and memory grows by roughly one path per put, not by the size of the trie.

## Experiment

Optional. Predict first, then run.

1. **Copy the whole trie.** Deep-clone every node in `put`. Which test notices (hint: sharing), and which does not?
2. **No pruning.** Leave empty nodes behind in `remove`. Which property shows it?

## Other designs

- **Path copying with `Arc` (ours, BusTub's):** simple, `O(len)` per write.
- **A mutable trie behind a lock:** fastest single-threaded, no old versions.
- **A persistent trie with structural hashing** (HAMT in Clojure and Scala): fewer levels, wide fan-out, the same sharing idea.
- **Reference counting or epochs** when `Arc` cloning becomes the bottleneck.

## In BusTub

`trie.h`: "`// Create a new trie with the given root.`", `Put`: "`template <class T> auto Put(std::string_view key, T value) const -> Trie;`" and the tests `CopyOnWriteTest1`, `2`, `3` (old versions stay intact), `PointerStability` (the value of an untouched key keeps its address) and `NonCopyableTest`.

## The C/C++ way

| C / C++ | Rust |
|---|---|
| `node->Clone()` (a virtual method so that nodes with values copy their value) | `(**n).clone()`: derived `Clone`; the value is an `Arc`, so copying it is a pointer copy |
| `std::make_shared<const TrieNode>(...)` | `Arc::new(...)` |
| `std::move(value)` into a `shared_ptr<T>` | `Arc::new(value)`: moved, never copied |

**Port rule:** "clone, then modify the clone" is the whole copy-on-write protocol; shared data is never touched in place.
