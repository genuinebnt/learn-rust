A challenge: no walkthrough, no hints, no solution. It is extra practice and does not count towards the course.

## What to fix

`push_not` in `src/optimizer/push_not.rs` pushes every `NOT` of a boolean expression down to the variables, using De Morgan's laws, so that the result has `Not` only directly on variables. One of the two laws is written wrong. Find the bug and fix it.

## Why

A rewrite is correct only if the result means the same thing, and the only convincing evidence is to compare the truth tables. De Morgan is the textbook case: `NOT (a AND b)` is `NOT a OR NOT b`, not `AND`. An optimiser that gets it wrong still runs, returns rows, and returns the wrong ones.

## The contract

- `push_not(e)` returns an expression with the same truth table as `e` in which `Not` is applied only to variables, and no `Not Not` remains.
- The laws: `NOT (a AND b) = NOT a OR NOT b`, `NOT (a OR b) = NOT a AND NOT b`, `NOT NOT a = a`.

## Invariants

These must hold after every step, whatever the input:

- For every assignment of the variables, `eval(push_not(e)) == eval(e)`.
- `Not` appears only on `Var` nodes in the result.

## Relations between input and output

How the answer must change when the input changes. The property tests check these on random inputs:

- `push_not(push_not(e)) == push_not(e)`.
- `push_not(Not(e))` is the negation of `push_not(e)` on every assignment.
- The number of variables mentioned is unchanged.

## Examples

Worked cases (the tests include them):

```text
NOT (a AND b) -> NOT a OR NOT b
NOT (a OR NOT b) -> NOT a AND b
```

## What the tests check

- Each law.
- Nested negations.
- A property: equal truth tables on every assignment.

## Done when

All the `s3h_c4` tests pass, and you can say in one sentence what the bug was.
