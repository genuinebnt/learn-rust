A challenge: no walkthrough, no hints, no solution. It is extra practice and does not count towards the course.

## What to fix

`redo` in `src/recovery/redo_pass.rs` replays log records onto pages after a crash. Each page remembers the LSN of the last record applied to it (`page_lsn`). It looks right, and on a page that had already been flushed with newer changes, recovery writes an **older** value back over it. Find the bug and fix it.

## Why

Redo must be **idempotent**: replaying the whole log from the start gives the same result as replaying only what the disk is missing, because recovery cannot know which pages were flushed before the crash. The page LSN is how: apply a record only if the page has not seen it yet. Skip the check and recovery undoes work the disk already had.

## The contract

- `redo(pages, log)`: `pages[p]` is `(page_lsn, value)`; each record is `(lsn, page, new value)` in increasing LSN order.
- A record is applied iff `lsn > page_lsn`; applying sets the value and `page_lsn = lsn`.

## Invariants

These must hold after every step, whatever the input:

- A page's `page_lsn` never decreases.
- After redo, every page's value is the value of the record with the highest LSN for it that is at least its previous `page_lsn` (or its original value).

## Relations between input and output

How the answer must change when the input changes. The property tests check these on random inputs:

- Running `redo` twice gives the same pages as running it once.
- Starting from pages that already reflect a prefix of the log gives the same result as starting from empty pages.
- Records already reflected are skipped, and nothing is applied out of order.

## Examples

Worked cases (the tests include them):

```text
page 0 = (5, 'new'); log [(3, 0, 'old'), (7, 0, 'newer')] -> (7, 'newer'), and 'old' is never written
```

## What the tests check

- A page ahead of the log.
- Repeated redo.
- A property: any prefix already applied gives the same final state.

## Done when

All the `s4c_c3` tests pass, and you can say in one sentence what the bug was.
