//! What `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` measures: for each node of a plan, how many rows it produced, in how many batches, how many times it was
//! initialised and how long its calls took (children included). Given code; module 3i uses it. It names no plan type, so it compiles
//! in every unlock state (the plan types arrive with module 3d).
