# The Learn page and the problem tags: the specification

Status: **decided by the owner, 2026-10-10. Do not deviate.** Every rule below is the owner's own wording turned into a rule; a
change to a rule is the owner's decision, recorded here first. This supersedes the "listed techniques" and "group problems" ideas of
DSA.md decision 32's first build, and the options in DSA_MUST_SOLVE_PLAN.md (that file keeps the scoring and the data).

## 1. What the Learn page is

The Learn page of a pattern shows **all the common techniques of that topic, each with Python code and an explanation, and the
LeetCode problems that practise it**.

| rule | |
|---|---|
| L1 | A technique **that has LeetCode problems** is shown with its **implementation** (a Python template that runs and is tested, with the explanation: when to use it, the traps) **and its problems**. Whether the problems are in a NeetCode list or not makes no difference. |
| L2 | A technique that **has no LeetCode problem** is **not given a card**. It is only named, in a list **at the bottom of the page**. |
| L3 | Layout of a technique card: **left = the implementation** (the current left side: signals, template with its tabs, pitfalls), **right = the problems** (the current right side). |
| L4 | A technique never appears with problems and without an implementation. A technique without an implementation is either written first or has no problems attached. |
| L5 | Sections (groups) are only headings that organise the cards. They carry no problems of their own. |

## 2. The problems on the right of a card

| rule | |
|---|---|
| P1 | Every problem is a **catalog problem**: it opens the site's own **problem page** (statement, hints, the log of attempts) and that page links to LeetCode to solve it, exactly like the NeetCode ones. |
| P2 | A problem that is **not** in a NeetCode list has **no solution attached** (no `pages/<slug>.toml` is required). Solutions may be added to any problem later; the data model must allow it (rule S1). |
| P3 | A problem belongs to one technique (its `technique`) and appears under that technique's pattern. A technique card may also list a problem of another technique as an *example* (`examples` of an `[[extra]]`) when the same idea solves it. |
| P4 | Free problems only; a premium problem is never added (it cannot be solved without a subscription). |
| P5 | Problems that are not in a NeetCode list are **added to the catalog** (as `practice` problems in `content/dsa/practice.json`) so that they are tracked. |

## 3. The tags (every problem row, everywhere)

| tag | values | rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD` | always |
| **Priority** | `MUST`, `STRONG`, `PRACTICE`, `WARM-UP` | always. In a NeetCode list: `MUST` is the list's must-learn problem, the rest are `PRACTICE`. Outside the lists: computed from company frequency and concept weight (DSA_MUST_SOLVE_PLAN.md section 2): tier A `MUST`, tier B `STRONG`, easy trivia `WARM-UP`, the rest `PRACTICE`. |
| **Recent** | `RECENT` | asked by a company in the last six months (shown beside the priority) |
| **List** | `BLIND 75`, `NEETCODE 150`, `NEETCODE 250`, `NEETCODE ALL`, or **nothing** | the **narrowest** list the problem is in: in Blind 75 and the 150 → `BLIND 75`; in the 150 and the 250 → `NEETCODE 150`. **Empty if it is in no list.** |
| **Solution** | `SOLUTION` | present when the site has a written solution (a page) for it. Absent otherwise. |
| **Companies** | the company names | **mandatory on every problem**, from the same company set the site has today (`company_groups` in `problems.json`). Shown as chips (first three, the rest on hover). |
| **Topics** | LeetCode's own topic tags | **mandatory on every problem**. |

A problem without a company or without a topic tag is an error (rule V1). A premium or SQL/shell/concurrency problem is never added.

## 4. Tracking

| rule | |
|---|---|
| T1 | A problem that is not in a NeetCode list is **tracked**: not solved / partly solved / solved, the log of attempts, activity. The same log and states as any problem. |
| T2 | It is **not part of completion**: it does not count in the NeetCode list totals, a track's readiness, the home counters or the goal. |
| T3 | It is **not part of repetition**: logging it never creates a review. |
| T4 | It is **not part of the calendar and plan**. |
| T5 | In the Practice page's right-hand list, problems of the lists and the others are **visibly different**: the list tag appears only on the list ones; the others show none (rule in section 3). |

This is what `is_practice` already does in the API; the new problems use it unchanged.

## 5. Where the data lives (one place each)

| what | where |
|---|---|
| techniques with implementations | `content/dsa/lessons/<pattern>.toml`: `[[technique]]` (from the lists) and `[[extra]]` (the others), each with `signals`, `template` (+ variants), `pitfalls`, and a `group` |
| the names of techniques that have no problem | `[[listed]]` in the same file, with `name` and `group` only (no `problems`) |
| problems that are not in a NeetCode list | `content/dsa/practice.json` (with `technique` = a technique or extra id, `priority`, `companies`, `tags`, `recent`) |
| priority scores and their inputs | `content/dsa/must_solve.json` (generated by `tools/neetcode/must_solve.py` from the weights file) |
| written solutions | `content/dsa/pages/<slug>.toml` (unchanged); `SOLUTION` is "a page exists" |

## 6. Rules the build enforces (CI fails otherwise)

| id | check |
|---|---|
| V1 | every catalog problem has at least one company (from the site's company set) and one topic tag |
| V2 | every `technique` of a practice problem is a technique of `problems.json` or an `[[extra]]` of its pattern |
| V3 | every technique or extra has signals, a template that **runs** and passes its behaviour test, and pitfalls |
| V4 | every technique that has a problem has a lesson (L4); a `[[listed]]` entry is never shown with problems (its `problems`, if any, are candidates waiting for an implementation) |
| V5 | no premium problem in `practice.json` |
| V6 | a problem's `lists` decide its list tag; nothing else sets it |
| V7 | progress safety: no problem id that has progress is removed or renamed without an entry in `retired.txt` / the renames |

## 8. The key insight of every problem (decided 2026-10-10, to be built after the technique cards)

One short sentence that names the move that solves the problem: "Shortest path in an unweighted graph: BFS." "Pair lookup: a hash map of what you have passed." It is not a solution and not a hint; it is what a strong candidate says first.

| rule | |
|---|---|
| K1 | **Every catalog problem has one**: NeetCode-list and practice problems alike (about 1,660). |
| K2 | One sentence, at most 110 characters, no code, no spoilers of the final algorithm's details; it names the pattern or the observation. |
| K3 | Stored in one place: `content/dsa/insights.json`, `{ "<slug>": "<sentence>" }`. Problem pages (`pages/<slug>.toml`) keep their longer Idea text; the insight is separate. |
| K4 | Shown under the tags on the problem page, and as the second line of a problem row on the Learn and Practice pages (replacing nothing: companies and topics stay). |
| K5 | Build check V8: every problem of `problems.json` and `practice.json` has an insight within the length limit; a premium problem has one too (it is about the idea, not the statement). |
| K6 | Written per technique first (the card's signals are the starting point), then per problem; reviewed against the problem's technique so the sentence agrees with the card it sits under. |

Order of work: finish the technique cards of every topic first (docs/DSA_LEARN_PAGE_STATUS.md), then write the insights.

## 7. Status

Kept in DSA_LEARN_PAGE_STATUS.md: per topic, how many techniques have a card, how many problems are attached, how many names are at
the bottom, what is still to write. It is regenerated by `tools/neetcode/learn_status.py`.
