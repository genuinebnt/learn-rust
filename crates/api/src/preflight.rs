//! Keeping progress safe across deploys.
//!
//! - [`apply_renames`] runs at startup: rows stored under a problem's old id (`renamed_from` in problem.toml) move
//!   to its current id, so renaming or moving a problem keeps its attempts, reviews, drafts and focus time.
//! - [`check`] is `anneal-api preflight`, which deploy/deploy.sh runs with the new image against the live database
//!   before switching over. It fails when the new version would strand progress (an id with stored rows that the
//!   new content doesn't know) or when an applied migration was edited (sqlx would refuse to start). The old
//!   version keeps serving until both are fixed.
