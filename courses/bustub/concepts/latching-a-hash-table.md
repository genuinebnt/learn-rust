title: Latching a three-level index: header, directory, bucket
summary: Which latch each level takes in each mode, why a parent is released only after its child is held, what the insert path holds across a split, and the deadlock-free order the tests exercise.

The hash table is shared. Many threads look up and insert at once, and a split changes the directory under a lookup's feet. The pool already gives every page a reader-writer latch (module 1g); this page is the **protocol** for using them on a path from the root to a leaf, which the B+ tree in module 2c reuses almost unchanged.

## The path and the modes

A lookup walks **header → directory → bucket**. Each step is a page, so each step takes that page's latch. Which mode?

| operation | header | directory | bucket |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_value` | read | read | read |
| `insert` | read (write if it must create a directory) | **write** (a split may change it) | write |
| `remove` | read | **write** (a merge may change it) | write |

Reads share; writers exclude. The `insert` and `remove` paths take the *directory* in write mode up front, because they cannot know until they have looked at the bucket whether a split or merge will follow, and upgrading a read latch to a write latch is not possible without releasing it (a gap where the bucket may change).

## Latch crabbing: take the child, then let go of the parent

```rust
let directory_guard = self.bpm.write_page(directory_page_id);   // child latched...
drop(header_guard);                                              // ...now the parent can go
let bucket_guard = self.bpm.write_page(bucket_page_id);
// the directory stays latched while the bucket may be split
```

The walk **holds the parent until the child is latched**, then releases the parent: the hand-over-hand pattern called **crabbing**. Releasing the parent *before* taking the child would leave a gap in which the header's pointer could change to a different directory. And it releases the parent *as soon as it is safe*, so other threads can use it: a lookup that has the directory and the bucket need not keep the header.

When is a parent "safe" to release? When the child **cannot change the parent**: a bucket with room cannot split, so the directory above it will not be modified. This hash table is coarse (the insert holds the directory for the whole operation); the B+ tree release rule is finer: release all ancestors when the child is *safe* (it will not split or merge).

```

## Rules the tests check

- **Consistent order**: always header, then directory, then bucket, and for two buckets (a merge), the lower slot first. No thread ever waits for an earlier page while holding a later one, so there is no cycle (see the deadlock concept).
- **Hold the directory across a split**: nobody can read the directory half-updated.
- **Drop the bucket guard before deleting its page**: `delete_page` refuses a pinned page, and the guard holds a pin. Dropping first is what makes the delete succeed (and an insert-merge path that forgets it leaks a page).
- **Release on every path**: guards do this by themselves, including on early `return false`: the RAII payoff.

## What this costs, and the finer alternatives

| design | concurrency | complexity |
|---|---|---|
| one latch for the whole table | none | trivial |
| **crabbing with the directory held for the operation** (this course) | readers parallel; writers serialise per directory | moderate |
| latch the bucket only, optimistic directory read | high | needs a version/validation step (retry on change) |
| lock-free | highest | very hard |

The concurrency tests run several threads inserting and reading at once and check that nothing deadlocks and `verify_integrity` still holds afterwards. A timeout that reports "stuck" is part of the test, because the failure mode of a wrong latch order is not a wrong answer: it is silence.

> [!TIP] Pin counts as a leak detector
> After any test, every page's pin count should be zero (`get_pin_count`). A path that returns early while still holding a guard shows up there immediately, long before it starves the pool.

## In real code

### Using it: crabbing down a three-level path, runnable

A miniature of the table's latching, with real `RwLock`s standing in for page latches. The point is the **order and overlap** of acquire and release, which you copy into the stages.

```rust test
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
use std::thread;

struct Bucket { items: Vec<(u32, u32)>, cap: usize }
struct Directory { buckets: Vec<Arc<RwLock<Bucket>>> }                       // slot -> bucket page
struct Header { directories: Vec<Arc<RwLock<Directory>>> }

fn get_value(header: &RwLock<Header>, key: u32) -> Option<u32> {
    let h = header.read().unwrap();                                           // 1. latch the header (shared)
    let dir = h.directories[(key >> 31) as usize].clone();
    let dir_guard = dir.read().unwrap();                                      // 2. latch the child BEFORE letting go of the parent
    drop(h);                                                                  //    now the header is free for other threads
    let bucket = dir_guard.buckets[(key & 1) as usize].clone();
    let b = bucket.read().unwrap();
    drop(dir_guard);                                                          //    lookups never modify the directory: release it
    b.items.iter().find(|(k, _)| *k == key).map(|(_, v)| *v)
}

fn insert(header: &RwLock<Header>, key: u32, value: u32) -> bool {
    let h = header.read().unwrap();
    let dir = h.directories[(key >> 31) as usize].clone();
    let dir_guard = dir.write().unwrap();                                     // WRITE: a split would modify the directory
    drop(h);
    let bucket = dir_guard.buckets[(key & 1) as usize].clone();
    let mut b = bucket.write().unwrap();
    if b.items.iter().any(|(k, _)| *k == key) || b.items.len() >= b.cap {
        return false;                                                         // every exit path drops the guards: RAII
    }
    b.items.push((key, value));
    true
}

#[test]
fn readers_and_writers_on_a_three_level_path() {
    let mk = || Arc::new(RwLock::new(Bucket { items: vec![], cap: 100 }));
    let dir = Arc::new(RwLock::new(Directory { buckets: vec![mk(), mk()] }));
    let header = RwLock::new(Header { directories: vec![dir.clone(), dir] });
    thread::scope(|s| {
        for t in 0..4u32 {
            let header = &header;
            s.spawn(move || {
                for i in 0..20 {
                    assert!(insert(header, t * 100 + i, i));
                    assert!(get_value(header, t * 100 + i).is_some());
                }
            });
        }
    });
    assert_eq!(get_value(&header, 3), Some(3));
}
```

```rust test
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
use std::thread;

#[test]
fn a_consistent_order_never_deadlocks() {
    // Two buckets latched together (a merge) are always taken lower slot first, whichever thread asks.
    let a = Arc::new(RwLock::new(0));
    let b = Arc::new(RwLock::new(0));
    let both = |first: &RwLock<i32>, second: &RwLock<i32>| {
        let mut x = first.write().unwrap();
        let mut y = second.write().unwrap();
        *x += 1;
        *y += 1;
    };
    thread::scope(|s| {
        for _ in 0..4 {
            s.spawn(|| for _ in 0..500 { both(&a, &b) });                      // every thread: a then b
        }
    });
    assert_eq!((*a.read().unwrap(), *b.read().unwrap()), (2000, 2000));
}
```

### In the exercises

- **2b-02, 2b-04:** `get_value` read-latches header, directory and bucket, releasing each parent once its child is held; `insert` and `remove` take the directory in write mode from the start and drop the header as soon as the directory is latched.
- **2b-10 (`remove`):** the same path; **drop the bucket guard before the merge**, because `delete_page` refuses a pinned page.
- **2b-11:** when you merge two buckets, take their guards in the same slot order every time (the second example).
- **Tests:** the concurrent stage test runs several threads of inserts and lookups with a timeout; any ordering mistake shows up as a hang.

### Where it is used

- **B+ tree traversal** in PostgreSQL's nbtree, InnoDB and BusTub (module 2c): the same *latch the child, then release the parent* step, with "safe node" rules to release more than one ancestor.
- **Lock-coupled linked lists and trees** in kernels and concurrent collections (hand-over-hand locking).
- **Filesystems**: path lookup takes a directory's lock, then the child's, then releases the parent.
