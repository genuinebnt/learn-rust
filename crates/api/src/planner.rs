//! The plan: which problem is solved on which day, and where each review lands (docs/DSA.md, decision 28).
//!
//! The plan is a pure function of *rules* (scope, order, targets), the *calendar* (each date is a problem day, a
//! practice day or a break, over the weekly routine) and what has already been done. Nothing about the future is
//! stored, so changing a rule or an override moves everything after it, and changing it back puts it all back.
