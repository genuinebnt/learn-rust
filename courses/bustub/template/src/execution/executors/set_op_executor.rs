//! `UNION`, `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`, each with and without `ALL`. Module 3j.
//!
//! Rows are compared as *values*, and two NULLs are the same value here (unlike in `WHERE a = b`): `select null union select null` is
//! one row. Without `ALL` the result has no duplicates; with `ALL` rows are counted: `INTERSECT ALL` keeps a row as often as both sides
//! have it (the smaller count), `EXCEPT ALL` as often as the left has it more than the right.
