//! Port of `src/include/primer/orset.h`, `orset.cpp`, `orset_driver.h` and `orset_driver.cpp`: an **observed-remove set**, a CRDT
//! (conflict-free replicated data type). Replicas of the set on different machines accept adds and removes independently, and
//! merging any two replicas in any order, any number of times, gives the same set: it converges without a coordinator.
//!
//! The trick is to name every *add*: `add(elem, uid)` creates the pair `(elem, uid)`. A `remove(elem)` kills the pairs for `elem` that
//! this replica **has seen**, and remembers them as removed. An element is in the set while it has a pair that is not removed. A
//! concurrent add elsewhere has a pair this replica never saw, so it survives the merge: **add wins**.
