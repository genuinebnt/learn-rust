title: Multi-version concurrency control: readers that never wait
summary: Why a database keeps several versions of a row, how a timestamp tells a reader which one it may see, and the three ways to store the old versions (BusTub keeps the newest in the table and the older ones as undo logs).

Two transactions touch the same row: one is adding up a balance sheet, the other is moving money. With **locks**, the reader waits for the writer or the writer waits for the reader, and a long report stalls every update it touches. **Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)** avoids the wait by never overwriting what somebody may still be reading: a write makes a **new version** of the row, and a reader looks at the version that was current when *it* began.

## The three parts of any MVCC design

1. **A timestamp on every version**: when it was committed (a number from a counter, see *logical clocks*). Until its writer commits, a version carries a *temporary* timestamp that no reader can mistake for a commit time.
2. **A rule for what a reader sees**: the newest version with a timestamp at or before the reader's **read timestamp**, or one the reader itself wrote. The read timestamp is fixed when the transaction begins, so it sees one consistent *snapshot* however long it runs.
3. **A place for the old versions**, and a way to find them from the newest.

Part 2 is what makes reads lock-free: a reader never changes anything, never waits for a writer, and a writer never waits for a reader. Writers still conflict with other writers; that is the next article (*snapshot isolation*).

## Where the old versions live

| design | newest version | older versions | used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **append-only** | in the table, with the others | in the table, in the same heap | PostgreSQL |
| **time travel** | in the table | in a separate table of old rows | SQL Server's version store |
| **delta / undo log** | in the table, **updated in place** | as small *deltas* in per-transaction undo logs, linked newest to oldest | MySQL InnoDB, HyPer; **BusTub** |

The delta design makes the common case cheap: most reads want the newest version, and it is right there in the table, where an index also points. A reader that needs an older one follows the chain of undo logs and *undoes* changes until it reaches the version it may see. That chain is the next article.

## The costs

- **Space.** Old versions pile up until nobody can need them: that is **garbage collection**, driven by the *watermark* (the oldest read timestamp still running).
- **Time for old readers.** A long-running reader has to walk long chains.
- **Weaker isolation than it looks.** A snapshot is not serializable by itself (*write skew*); stronger levels add validation.

## C++ comparison

| C / C++ | Rust |
|---|---|
| a version = `struct { timestamp_t ts; Tuple tuple; Version *next; }` with raw `next` pointers | a version = a value in a `Vec` owned by its transaction; the "pointer" is a plain `(txn id, index)` pair that can be checked (and may dangle after garbage collection, returning `None`) |
| `std::atomic<timestamp_t>` read by every reader | `AtomicI64` with `Ordering::SeqCst` (or a `Mutex`) |

**Port rule:** replace a pointer to a version by an id you look up in a map; "the version is gone" becomes an `Option`, not a crash.

## In real code

### Using it: a versioned cell

```rust test
/// A value with its history: `(commit timestamp, value)`, oldest first.
#[derive(Default)]
struct Cell {
    versions: Vec<(i64, i32)>,
}

impl Cell {
    /// A committed write at `ts` (timestamps grow).
    fn write(&mut self, ts: i64, value: i32) {
        assert!(self.versions.last().map_or(true, |&(last, _)| last < ts));
        self.versions.push((ts, value));
    }

    /// The newest version committed at or before `read_ts`.
    fn read(&self, read_ts: i64) -> Option<i32> {
        self.versions.iter().rev().find(|&&(ts, _)| ts <= read_ts).map(|&(_, v)| v)
    }
}

#[test]
fn a_reader_sees_the_version_at_its_read_timestamp() {
    let mut balance = Cell::default();
    balance.write(1, 100);
    balance.write(3, 80);
    assert_eq!(balance.read(2), Some(100));
    assert_eq!(balance.read(3), Some(80));
    assert_eq!(balance.read(99), Some(80));
}

#[test]
fn a_row_did_not_exist_before_its_first_version() {
    let mut balance = Cell::default();
    balance.write(5, 1);
    assert_eq!(balance.read(4), None);
}
```

### Using it: a snapshot does not move

```rust test
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

struct Db {
    // (commit ts, value) pairs and the last commit timestamp
    rows: Mutex<(Vec<(i64, i32)>, i64)>,
}

impl Db {
    fn begin(&self) -> i64 {
        self.rows.lock().unwrap().1 // read ts = the newest commit
    }
    fn read(&self, read_ts: i64) -> i32 {
        let guard = self.rows.lock().unwrap();
        guard.0.iter().rev().find(|&&(ts, _)| ts <= read_ts).unwrap().1
    }
    fn commit_write(&self, value: i32) {
        let mut guard = self.rows.lock().unwrap();
        guard.1 += 1;
        let ts = guard.1;
        guard.0.push((ts, value));
    }
}

#[test]
fn a_long_reader_is_not_disturbed_by_commits() {
    let db = Arc::new(Db { rows: Mutex::new((vec![(0, 10)], 0)) });
    let reader = db.begin();
    let writer = {
        let db = db.clone();
        std::thread::spawn(move || {
            for v in 11..=15 {
                db.commit_write(v);
            }
        })
    };
    writer.join().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(db.read(reader), 10, "the snapshot is the one from when it began");
    assert_eq!(db.read(db.begin()), 15, "a new reader sees the latest");
}
```

### In the exercises

- **4a-02 / 4a-03:** the transaction manager hands out the read timestamp (`begin`) and the commit timestamp (`commit`) that make the rule above work.
- **4a-08:** the sequential scan applies the rule to every tuple of a table.
- **Module 4b:** writes that leave a version behind, and the garbage collector that removes versions nobody can read.

### Where it is used

- **PostgreSQL**: every `UPDATE` writes a new row version; `xmin`/`xmax` say which transactions created and deleted it, and `VACUUM` reclaims dead versions.
- **MySQL InnoDB**: the clustered index holds the newest version; older ones are rebuilt from undo logs by a *read view*.
- **HyPer** (Neumann, Mühlbauer, Kemper, "Fast Serializable Multi-Version Concurrency Control for Main-Memory Database Systems", SIGMOD 2015): in-place updates with undo-buffer chains, the design BusTub's project follows.
- **SQL Server** snapshot isolation and **Oracle**'s read consistency also serve readers from older versions rather than locking.
