//! Port of `src/include/primer/skiplist.h` and `src/primer/skiplist.cpp`: an ordered set as a **skip list**, a linked list with express
//! lanes. Every node has a random height; a node of height `h` is linked into the lists of levels `0..h`; searching starts on the top
//! level and drops down a level whenever the next node is too far. Expected `O(log n)` search, insert and erase, without rebalancing.
//!
//! C++ links nodes with `shared_ptr`. Here the nodes live in a `Vec` (an arena) and a link is the **index** of the next node, which is
//! how Rust usually builds linked structures without `Rc<RefCell<..>>`. The whole list is behind one reader-writer lock.
