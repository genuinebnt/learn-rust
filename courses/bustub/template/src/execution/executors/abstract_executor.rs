//! Port of `src/include/execution/executors/abstract_executor.h`. BusTub's executors use the **iterator** (Volcano) model with
//! batches: `init` prepares, then `next` is called until it says there is nothing more; each call fills a batch of up to `batch_size`
//! tuples (and the rids they came from). A parent pulls from its children the same way. Given code.
