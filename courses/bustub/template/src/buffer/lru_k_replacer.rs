//! Port of `src/buffer/lru_k_replacer.cpp`: the LRU-K policy (O'Neil, O'Neil, Weikum, SIGMOD 1993).
//!
//! LRU-K evicts the frame whose **backward k-distance** is largest: the time since its k-th most recent access. A frame with fewer
//! than k recorded accesses has an infinite distance, and among those the one whose *first* access is oldest goes first (plain LRU).
//! One long scan can't flush the pool, because scanned pages have been touched once and are evicted before pages touched twice.
//!
//! The replacer keeps a logical clock that advances by one on every recorded access. A frame is **tracked** from its first
//! recorded access until it is evicted or removed (which forget it, history included). Tracked frames start out not evictable.

// TODO(1d-01): your imports go here.
