//! Crash recovery, ARIES-style but small. After a restart the pages on disk hold *some* of the changes the log describes (any page may
//! have been written before the crash or not) and the log holds every change whose records were flushed. Recovery **repeats history**
//! (redo: put every logged change in place, in log order, whether or not its transaction finished) and then **undoes the losers**
//! (the transactions that neither committed nor finished rolling back), logging each undo like a rollback does.
