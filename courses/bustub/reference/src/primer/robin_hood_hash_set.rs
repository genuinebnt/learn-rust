//! Port of `src/include/primer/robin_hood_hash_set.h` and `src/primer/robin_hood_hash_set.cpp`: a fixed-capacity hash set that resolves
//! collisions by **linear probing with Robin Hood displacement**.
//!
//! Every key has a *home bucket* (`hash % capacity`) and is stored at the first bucket from there that suits it. The *probe distance*
//! of a key is how far it sits from its home. Robin Hood hashing takes from the rich and gives to the poor: when an incoming key is
//! further from its home than the key it meets, it takes that bucket and the displaced key probes on. That keeps probe distances even,
//! and keeps the longest probe short. A removed key leaves a **tombstone**.
