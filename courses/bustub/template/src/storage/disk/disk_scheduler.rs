//! Port of `src/storage/disk/disk_scheduler.cpp` (BusTub, MIT, Copyright (c) 2015-2025 Carnegie Mellon University Database Group).
//!
//! The disk scheduler runs disk reads and writes on a background thread. Callers hand it requests and wait on a future when they
//! need the result, so the buffer pool can start several I/Os and do other work meanwhile. How the scheduler and the requests
//! are built is yours; the tests use only the public items in this file.
