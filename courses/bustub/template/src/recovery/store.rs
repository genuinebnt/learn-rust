//! A tiny transactional record store on table pages: the thing the log protects. Records are fixed-size byte strings living in
//! slots of a few pre-allocated heap pages; a record is addressed by its [`Rid`]. Transactions write records (insert, update, delete);
//! every write is described to the log **before** it reaches the page; a commit makes its log records durable; pages go to disk when
//! somebody calls [`Store::flush_page`], and never otherwise (the tests keep the pool big enough that nothing is evicted behind the
//! store's back; a real system hooks eviction).
//!
//! The store is strict: a record written by an active transaction cannot be written by another until the first ends, so a crash never
//! leaves a committed change on top of an uncommitted one.
