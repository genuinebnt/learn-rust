Emptying a bucket on removal would cut the probe chains of keys that went past it. Instead `remove` leaves a **tombstone**: lookups probe past it, inserts may reuse it. This stage adds `remove`, `clear` and the statistic `max_probe_distance`, and checks the whole set against Rust's `HashSet` on a random workload.

> [!CHECK] Capacity 8; three keys a, b, c share home bucket 2 and sit in buckets 2, 3 and 4. You remove b. Why does the table put a tombstone in bucket 3 instead of marking it empty? What would `find(c)` do otherwise?
> ||`find` stops at the first empty bucket, because a key cannot be beyond one. With bucket 3 empty, `find(c)` would probe 2, see a, probe 3, stop, and report "absent" although c is in bucket 4. A tombstone says "something was here, keep probing".||

## The task

- `remove(&key) -> bool`: write lock; find the key; absent: `false`; otherwise leave a **tombstone** in its bucket (not an empty one: a lookup that stops at an empty bucket would never reach keys that were placed past it), size - 1, `true`.
- `clear()`: write lock; every bucket empty; size 0; the capacity stays.
- `max_probe_distance()`: read lock; the largest probe distance over **live** buckets; 0 for an empty table. Tombstones do not count.
- inserts may **reuse** a tombstone (and the lookup still probes past tombstones).

The tests: exact scenarios (remove reports whether the key was there; a lookup continues past a tombstone; an insert reuses a tombstone; the maximum probe distance ignores tombstones; a key stays reachable when a tombstone in front of it is reused; random inserts and removes agree with a hash set; clear keeps the capacity; a table full of tombstones accepts inserts again), and a property: **any inserts, removes, lookups and clears on a small table against a `HashSet`** (an insert fails exactly when the table is full of other keys, every key found is at a bucket inside the table, tombstones pile up and are reused).

## Your freedom

How you remember a removed key (a bucket state); nothing else is specified.

## The Rust toolbox

**A tombstone is a state, not a hole.** `table.slots[bucket] = Slot::Tombstone;` keeps the probe sequence of every key that went past it intact.

**Statistics with `filter_map`.** `slots.iter().enumerate().filter_map(|(b, s)| match s { Slot::Live(k) => Some(distance(home(k), b)), _ => None }).max().unwrap_or(0)`.

**Reuse on insert.** In the probe loop an `Empty` or a `Tombstone` bucket takes the carried key; lookup, though, may only stop at `Empty`.

**`fill`.** `slots.fill(Slot::Empty)` (for `Clone` slots) resets the table in one call.

```rust
let Some(bucket) = self.find(&table, key) else { return false };
table.slots[bucket] = Slot::Tombstone;
table.size -= 1;
(0..self.capacity).filter_map(|b| match &table.slots[b] { Slot::Live(k) => Some(self.probe_distance(self.home_bucket(k), b)), _ => None }).max().unwrap_or(0)
```

## Design notes

**The size counts live keys only.** Tombstones are neither in `size` nor free of cost: they lengthen probes. A workload that inserts and removes many different keys fills the table with tombstones; BusTub's header says nothing about rebuilding, so this exercise does not either (the full-table check uses `size`, and inserts reuse tombstones, so the table never blocks while a free bucket exists).

**The model check.** A random workload mixing inserts and removes, checked against `HashSet` after *every* operation (size and membership), is a cheap way to find the bug that hand-written cases miss. The early-exit bug of stage 2 is found by it within a few hundred operations.

**Clear while others read.** `clear` takes the write lock; a concurrent `contains` sees either the old or the empty table, never a half-cleared one.

## If this is new

- [S4 Maps & sets](/t/s4-maps-sets): deletion in open addressing.
- [S6 Iterators](/t/s6-iterators): `filter_map`, `max`.
- [Y5 Testing & verification](/t/y5-testing-verification): a hash set as the oracle for a long random history.
- The optional *Robin Hood hashing and open addressing* concept.
- [F4 Hashing & purpose-built structures](/t/f4-hashing-structures): Hashing; Right structure for the job: open addressing, probe distance, tombstones.
- [L7 Enums & pattern matching](/t/l7-enums-patterns): Enums & exhaustiveness: `Slot<K>`: empty, removed or live.

## Tests

- Remove, tombstone behaviour, reuse, statistics, clear.
- Property: a `HashSet` model with a capacity, tombstones piling up.

## Hints

### Remove only what `find` found

Do not mark a bucket as a tombstone unless `find` returned it as holding the key.

### Compare against the model every step

Assert `size()` and a handful of `contains` after each operation; the first failing step is the bug.

### Tombstones are not live

`max_probe_distance` and `size` must skip them; `insert`'s duplicate check must not match them.

## Performance

Remove is a `find` plus one store. Tombstones cost probe length: after heavy churn a table needs a rebuild (not required here). `max_probe_distance` is a full scan, `O(capacity)`; it is a diagnostic, not a hot path.

**Measure it.** Insert and remove 1 000 000 different keys through a table of 1 024 buckets; watch lookups of absent keys slow as tombstones accumulate.

## Experiment

Optional. Predict first, then run.

1. **Empty instead of a tombstone.** Which test and which property find the broken probe chains?
2. **Stop at a closer key in lookup.** The textbook lookup does; why is it wrong here, and which test shows it?

## Other designs

- **Tombstones (ours, BusTub's).**
- **Backward-shift deletion** (the textbook Robin Hood): move the following keys back one step; no tombstones, more work per delete.
- **Rebuild when too many tombstones accumulate.**

## In BusTub

`robin_hood_hash_set.cpp`: "`@TODO(student) Mark an occupied matching slot as a tombstone without breaking concurrent operations.`". Tests: `TombstoneDeletionTest`, `TombstoneReuseTest`, `MaxProbeDistanceTest`, `ClearTest`.

## The C/C++ way

| C / C++ | Rust |
|---|---|
| a `state_` byte set to `kTombstone` | `Slot::Tombstone` |
| `std::unordered_set` as the model in a randomised test | `std::collections::HashSet` |

**Port rule:** a model-based test drives the structure and a trusted one with the same operations and compares after each.
