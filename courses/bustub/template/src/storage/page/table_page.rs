//! Port of `src/include/storage/page/table_page.h` and `src/storage/page/table_page.cpp`: a page that holds tuples. A tuple's address is
//! its **slot number** in the page: tuples never move, so a record id (page, slot) stays valid; deleting only marks the tuple. How the
//! page lays its slots and its tuples out is yours: BusTub's design is a **slotted page** (a slot array growing from the front and the
//! tuples from the back), described in the stage page; the tests only use the methods below.
