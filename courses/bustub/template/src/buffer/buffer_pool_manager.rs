//! Port of `src/buffer/buffer_pool_manager.cpp` (BusTub, MIT, Copyright (c) 2015-2025 Carnegie Mellon University Database Group).
//!
//! The buffer pool keeps a fixed number of pages in memory. A page is read from disk into a **frame** when it is first needed;
//! callers **pin** a page while they use it, so it can't be taken away; when a frame is needed and none is free, the
//! replacer picks a page nobody has pinned, which is written back first if it was modified.
//!
//! This module has the textbook interface (`fetch_page` / `unpin_page`, as in BusTub's earlier years). The next module wraps it in
//! RAII page guards, the interface BusTub's current tests use. What is inside the pool is yours; the tests use the public methods only,
//! and a pool works with **any** [`FrameReplacer`]: yours from module 1e or 1d, or one of your own.
