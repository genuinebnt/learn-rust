title: Errors you will meet: A persistent trie
summary: The compiler messages this module is most likely to provoke, what each one means in plain words, and the usual ways out.
minutes: 10
---

Compiler errors are the course's second teacher. These are the ones this module's designs tend to provoke. Each shows the message as `rustc` prints it (read it from the top: the first line says what, the arrows say where, the `help:` line often says how), what it means, where you will probably meet it here, and the usual fixes. The messages and the fixes on this page were produced and checked with a real compiler.

## E0599: No method named … found

**Where you will meet it here.** `downcast_ref` and `downcast` belong to `dyn Any`; the value must be `Any + Send + Sync`.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("db").unwrap();
    let mut buf = [0u8; 8];
    f.read_at(&mut buf, 0).unwrap();
}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0599]: no method named `read_at` found for struct `File` in the current scope
   --> src/main.rs:6:7
    |
  6 |     f.read_at(&mut buf, 0).unwrap();
    |       ^^^^^^^
    |
   ::: /Users/genuinebasilnt/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/std/src/os/unix/fs.rs:59:8
    |
 59 |     fn read_at(&self, buf: &mut [u8], offset: u64) -> io::Result<usize>;
    |        ------- the method is available for `File` here
    |
    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
help: there is a method `read` with a similar name, but with different arguments
   --> src/main.rs:800:5
    |
800 |     fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<usize>;
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: trait `FileExt` which provides `read_at` is implemented but not in scope;
    perhaps you want to import it
    |
  1 + use std::os::unix::fs::FileExt;
    |
```

**What it means.** The method exists, but it belongs to a trait, and a trait's methods can only be called when the trait is in scope. The message usually says which `use` to add.

**The usual ways out:**

- Read the `help:` line: it names the trait to import.
- If the method really does not exist for your type, check the type: you may be calling it on an `Option`, a `&&T` or a wrapper.
- Check the feature or platform: `FileExt` is in `std::os::unix`.

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::os::unix::fs::FileExt;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("db").unwrap();
    let mut buf = [0u8; 8];
    f.read_at(&mut buf, 0).unwrap();
}
```

## E0382: Use of a moved value

**Where you will meet it here.** Path copying clones `Arc`s, not nodes: using an `Arc` after moving it into the new node.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
struct Frame { data: Vec<u8> }

fn main() {
    let frame = Frame { data: vec![0; 4096] };
    let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || frame.data.len());
    println!("{}", frame.data.len());
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `frame.data`
 --> src/main.rs:6:20
  |
5 |     let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || frame.data.len());
  |                                     ------- ---------- variable moved due to use in closure
  |                                     |
  |                                     value moved into closure here
6 |     println!("{}", frame.data.len());
  |                    ^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `frame.data` has type `Vec<u8>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
```

**What it means.** A value has one owner. Passing it somewhere by value (a function call, a `move` closure, an assignment) gives the ownership away, and the old name is no longer usable.

**The usual ways out:**

- Borrow instead of moving: pass `&frame` where the callee only reads.
- Share ownership when two places really need it: `Arc` across threads, `Rc` on one thread, and clone the `Arc`, not the data.
- Clone the value if a copy is what you mean (and cheap enough).

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

struct Frame { data: Vec<u8> }

fn main() {
    let frame = Arc::new(Frame { data: vec![0; 4096] });
    let mine = Arc::clone(&frame);
    let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || mine.data.len());
    println!("{}", frame.data.len());
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

## E0106: Missing lifetime specifier

**Where you will meet it here.** `get` returns a reference into the trie: its lifetime is the trie's.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
struct Page { data: [u8; 8] }

struct Guard {
    page: &Page,
}

fn main() {}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:4:11
  |
4 |     page: &Page,
  |           ^ expected named lifetime parameter
  |
help: consider introducing a named lifetime parameter
  |
3 ~ struct Guard<'a> {
4 ~     page: &'a Page,
  |
```

**What it means.** A struct that holds a reference has to say how long the reference is valid, so the compiler can check that the struct never outlives what it points at. The name `'a` ties the two together.

**The usual ways out:**

- Add the lifetime parameter to the struct and every `impl` that mentions it.
- Own the data instead (`Arc<Page>`, an id) when the borrow makes the type hard to use: a guard that must be stored in a `Vec` or sent to a thread usually wants ownership.
- Remember: the lifetime is a promise you must keep, not a way to make the compiler stop.

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
struct Page { data: [u8; 8] }

struct Guard<'a> {
    page: &'a Page,
}

fn main() {}
```

## E0277: Cannot be sent between threads safely

**Where you will meet it here.** A value stored in a shared trie must be `Send + Sync`.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let shared = Rc::new(5);
    let h = std::thread::spawn(move || println!("{}", shared));
    h.join().unwrap();
}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0277]: `Rc<i32>` cannot be sent between threads safely
   --> src/main.rs:5:32
    |
  5 |     let h = std::thread::spawn(move || println!("{}", shared));
    |             ------------------ -------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    |             |                  |
    |             |                  `Rc<i32>` cannot be sent between threads safely
    |             |                  within this `{closure@not_send_bad.rs:5:32}`
    |             required by a bound introduced by this call
    |
    = help: within `{closure@not_send_bad.rs:5:32}`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<i32>`
note: required because it's used within this closure
   --> src/main.rs:5:32
    |
  5 |     let h = std::thread::spawn(move || println!("{}", shared));
    |                                ^^^^^^^
note: required by a bound in `spawn`
   --> src/main.rs:128:8
    |
125 | pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>
    |        ----- required by a bound in this function
...
128 |     F: Send + 'static,
    |        ^^^^ required by this bound in `spawn`
    = note: the full name for the type has been written to '/var/folders/w_/3v26sb_54bz5x_m_msjh4g800000gn/T/tmp2er014bx/not_send_bad.long-type-15024984715928364356.txt'
    = note: consider using `--verbose` to print the full type name to the console
```

**What it means.** A value that goes to another thread must be `Send`; a value shared by reference between threads must be `Sync`. `Rc`, `RefCell` and raw pointers are neither, because their bookkeeping is not thread safe.

**The usual ways out:**

- Use `Arc` for shared ownership across threads and `Mutex`/`RwLock` for shared changes.
- Read the *last* lines of the message: they say which field or type inside your struct is the one that is not `Send`.
- A `MutexGuard` is not `Send` either: finish with it before the thread boundary.

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

fn main() {
    let shared = Arc::new(5);
    let h = std::thread::spawn(move || println!("{}", shared));
    h.join().unwrap();
}
```
