//! Port of `src/include/execution/expressions/abstract_expression.h`. An expression is a tree: every node has children and, given a
//! tuple, computes a [`Value`]. BusTub's `AbstractExpression` is a C++ base class with virtual methods; here it is a trait, and
//! expressions are shared as `Arc<dyn Expression>` (BusTub's `std::shared_ptr<AbstractExpression>`). Given code.
