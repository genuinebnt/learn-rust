//! Port of `src/storage/index/b_plus_tree.cpp`: a B+ tree index whose nodes are pages in the buffer pool. Internal pages direct the
//! search; leaf pages hold the `(key, value)` pairs and are chained left to right for range scans. Keys are unique.
//!
//! A node is split when it overflows (a leaf the moment it holds `leaf_max_size` pairs, an internal page when it would need more
//! than `internal_max_size` children) and merged or topped up from a sibling when it underflows, so the tree grows and shrinks
//! at the root and every leaf is at the same depth.
//!
//! Latching is by guards, top down. Readers hold a parent until the child is latched ("latch crabbing"). Writers keep write guards
//! on the whole path (`Context::write_set`) until a child that cannot split or underflow is reached ("safe"), which lets them let go
//! of everything above it; and most writes try an optimistic path first that write-latches only the leaf.
