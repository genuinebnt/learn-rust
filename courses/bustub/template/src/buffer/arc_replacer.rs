//! Port of `src/buffer/arc_replacer.cpp`: the ARC replacement policy (Megiddo and Modha, FAST 2003), as BusTub specifies it.
//!
//! ARC keeps four lists, each ordered from the **oldest** entry to the **newest**.
//!
//! - `mru` holds the live frames that have been seen **once** recently; `mfu` holds the live frames seen **at least twice**.
//! - `mru_ghost` and `mfu_ghost` remember the page ids (not the data) of pages recently evicted from `mru` and `mfu`.
//!
//! A hit on a ghost tells ARC which side it evicted too eagerly, and it moves the **target size** `p` of `mru`. So ARC adapts
//! between recency-heavy and frequency-heavy workloads, and a scan cannot flush the frequently used pages. The rules are written out
//! in the stage pages and checked by the tests through `record_access`, `set_evictable`, `evict`, `remove` and `size` alone.
