//! A list whose elements can be reached, moved and removed by a handle in constant time.
//!
//! The replacers need "move this frame to the back" and "remove this frame" to be O(1) given something that names the frame. C++
//! gets that from `std::list` plus an iterator saved in a map; Rust's `std::collections::LinkedList` has no such handles, and a
//! linked structure made of references fights the borrow checker. How you build it is yours: indices into a `Vec` (an arena),
//! a `HashMap` keyed by a counter, `Rc<RefCell<..>>` nodes, or `unsafe` pointers. The tests use only the items in this file.
