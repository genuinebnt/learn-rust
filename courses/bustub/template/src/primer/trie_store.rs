//! Port of `src/include/primer/trie_store.h` and `src/primer/trie_store.cpp`: a thread-safe store over a persistent [`Trie`]. Readers take
//! a snapshot (a clone of the root pointer, cheap) and read it without holding any lock; one writer at a time builds the next version
//! and publishes it by swapping the root.
