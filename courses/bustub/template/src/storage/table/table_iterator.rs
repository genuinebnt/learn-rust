//! Port of `src/storage/table/table_iterator.cpp`: a sequential scan of a table heap. It is a cursor of a [`Rid`] and walks slot by slot
//! and page by page along the chain. It returns **every** tuple, deleted ones included (with their metadata): skipping the deleted is the
//! caller's job (the sequential scan executor does it).
