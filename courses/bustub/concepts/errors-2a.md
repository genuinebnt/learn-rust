title: Errors you will meet: Typed pages
summary: The compiler messages this module is most likely to provoke, what each one means in plain words, and the usual ways out.
minutes: 12
---

Compiler errors are the course's second teacher. These are the ones this module's designs tend to provoke. Each shows the message as `rustc` prints it (read it from the top: the first line says what, the arrows say where, the `help:` line often says how), what it means, where you will probably meet it here, and the usual fixes. The messages and the fixes on this page were produced and checked with a real compiler.

## E0308: Mismatched types

**Where you will meet it here.** Slot numbers are `usize` in indexing and `u16` in the page header: casts must be explicit.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
struct PageId(i32);

fn offset(page: PageId, page_size: usize) -> u64 {
    page.0 * page_size
}

fn main() {}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text

4 |     page.0 * page_size

   ::: /Users/genuinebasilnt/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/internal_macros.rs:22:9
    |
 22 |         const impl $imp<$u> for &$t {
    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `&i32` implements `Mul<i32>`
...
 33 |         const impl $imp<&$u> for $t {
    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `i32` implements `Mul<&i32>`
...
 44 |         const impl $imp<&$u> for &$t {
    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `&i32` implements `Mul`
    = note: this error originates in the macro `mul_impl` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
```

**What it means.** Rust never converts between integer types behind your back: `i32`, `usize` and `u64` are three different types, and so is a newtype around one of them.

**The usual ways out:**

- Convert on purpose: `as` for a plain cast, `u64::from(x)` when it cannot fail, `usize::try_from(x)?` when it can.
- Decide one type per quantity (an offset is `u64`, a length is `usize`) and convert at the edges.
- Check for a sign: converting a negative `i32` with `as u64` gives a huge number.

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
struct PageId(i32);

fn offset(page: PageId, page_size: usize) -> u64 {
    page.0 as u64 * page_size as u64
}

fn main() {}
```

## E0599: No method named … found

**Where you will meet it here.** Reading integers out of bytes is `u32::from_le_bytes`, on a fixed-size array: slices need `try_into`.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("db").unwrap();
    let mut buf = [0u8; 8];
    f.read_at(&mut buf, 0).unwrap();
}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0599]: no method named `read_at` found for struct `File` in the current scope
   --> src/main.rs:6:7
    |
  6 |     f.read_at(&mut buf, 0).unwrap();

    |
   ::: /Users/genuinebasilnt/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/std/src/os/unix/fs.rs:59:8
    |
 59 |     fn read_at(&self, buf: &mut [u8], offset: u64) -> io::Result<usize>;
    |        ------- the method is available for `File` here
    |
    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
help: there is a method `read` with a similar name, but with different arguments
   --> src/main.rs:800:5
    |
800 |     fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<usize>;
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: trait `FileExt` which provides `read_at` is implemented but not in scope;
    perhaps you want to import it
    |
  1 + use std::os::unix::fs::FileExt;
    |
```

**What it means.** The method exists, but it belongs to a trait, and a trait's methods can only be called when the trait is in scope. The message usually says which `use` to add.

**The usual ways out:**

- Read the `help:` line: it names the trait to import.
- If the method really does not exist for your type, check the type: you may be calling it on an `Option`, a `&&T` or a wrapper.
- Check the feature or platform: `FileExt` is in `std::os::unix`.

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::os::unix::fs::FileExt;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("db").unwrap();
    let mut buf = [0u8; 8];
    f.read_at(&mut buf, 0).unwrap();
}
```

## E0004: Non-exhaustive patterns

**Where you will meet it here.** A page's kind as an enum: every `match` must cover every kind.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
enum Mode { IntentionShared, Shared, Exclusive }

fn is_write(m: Mode) -> bool {
    match m {
        Mode::Exclusive => true,
        Mode::Shared => false,
    }
}

fn main() {}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `Mode::IntentionShared` not covered
 --> src/main.rs:4:11
  |
4 |     match m {
  |           ^ pattern `Mode::IntentionShared` not covered
  |
note: `Mode` defined here
 --> src/main.rs:1:6
  |
1 | enum Mode { IntentionShared, Shared, Exclusive }
  |      ^^^^   --------------- not covered
  = note: the matched value is of type `Mode`
help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled by adding a match arm with a
    wildcard pattern or an explicit pattern as shown
  |
6 ~         Mode::Shared => false,
7 ~         Mode::IntentionShared => todo!(),
  |
```

**What it means.** A `match` must cover every possible value. The message names the one you forgot, which is exactly why enums are good for states: add a variant and the compiler lists every `match` to update.

**The usual ways out:**

- Add the arm the message names.
- A catch-all `_ =>` silences the error now and hides the next forgotten variant: prefer it only when 'everything else' really is one case.
- Combine arms with `|` when they do the same thing.

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
enum Mode { IntentionShared, Shared, Exclusive }

fn is_write(m: Mode) -> bool {
    match m {
        Mode::Exclusive => true,
        Mode::Shared | Mode::IntentionShared => false,
    }
}

fn main() {}
```

## E0499: Two mutable borrows at once

**Where you will meet it here.** Moving entries inside a page array borrows two slots at once: use `copy_within` or `split_at_mut`.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut pages = vec![1u32, 2, 3];
    let first = &mut pages[0];
    let second = &mut pages[1];
    *first += *second;
}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `pages` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:4:23
  |
3 |     let first = &mut pages[0];
  |                      ----- first mutable borrow occurs here
4 |     let second = &mut pages[1];
  |                       ^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     *first += *second;
  |     ----------------- first borrow later used here
  |
  = help: use `.split_at_mut(position)` to obtain two mutable non-overlapping sub-slices
```

**What it means.** At any moment there can be many readers or exactly one writer of a value. Two `&mut` into the same `Vec` (even to different elements) break that, because the compiler cannot see that the indexes differ.

**The usual ways out:**

- Split the data: `split_at_mut`, `iter_mut`, `swap`, or separate fields instead of one big struct.
- Finish with the first borrow before you start the second.
- Keep indexes or ids instead of references, and look them up when you need them.

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut pages = vec![1u32, 2, 3];
    let (left, right) = pages.split_at_mut(1);
    left[0] += right[0];
}
```

## E0384: Cannot assign twice to an immutable variable

**Where you will meet it here.** Counters in the page header must be `mut` when you change them.

**A small program that does it:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let pins = 0;
    pins += 1;
    println!("{}", pins);
}
```

**What the compiler says:**

```text
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `pins`
 --> src/main.rs:3:5
  |
2 |     let pins = 0;
  |         ---- first assignment to `pins`
3 |     pins += 1;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
  |
help: consider making this binding mutable
  |
2 |     let mut pins = 0;
  |         +++
```

**What it means.** Variables are immutable unless declared `mut`. It is a feature: when you see `let mut`, you know to look for the change.

**The usual ways out:**

- Add `mut` if the variable is meant to change.
- Often a new binding is clearer: `let pins = pins + 1;`.
- If a struct field must change, the method needs `&mut self` (see the 'cannot borrow as mutable' error).

**One fix, compiled and checked:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut pins = 0;
    pins += 1;
    println!("{}", pins);
}
```
