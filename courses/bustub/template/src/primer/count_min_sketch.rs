//! Port of `src/include/primer/count_min_sketch.h` and `src/primer/count_min_sketch.cpp`: a **count-min sketch** estimates how often each
//! item occurred in a stream, in a fixed amount of memory. It is a `depth x width` matrix of counters. Every row has its own hash
//! function; adding an item adds one to the counter its hash selects in each row. An item's count is the **minimum** of its counters:
//! collisions can only add to a counter, never take away, so the minimum is the least inflated one, and the estimate is never too low.
