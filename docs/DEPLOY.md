# anneal · production

anneal runs at **https://anneal.genuinebasil.dev** on the Hetzner VM (`deploy@46.224.108.227`, Ubuntu, 2 vCPU,
4 GB). Every push to `master` that passes CI is deployed automatically.

## How it fits together

```
push to master ──► GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
                   ├─ rust: clippy -D warnings, cargo test (Postgres service), anneal validate
                   ├─ web: pnpm install, tsc + vite build
                   └─ deploy (master only, after both pass)
                        ├─ build + push ghcr.io/genuinebnt/anneal:<sha>         (Dockerfile)
                        ├─ build + push ghcr.io/genuinebnt/anneal-runner:<sha>  (docker/runner.Dockerfile)
                        └─ ssh deploy@VM "deploy <sha>"  ─► deploy/ssh-deploy.sh ─► deploy/deploy.sh

VM
  genuinedev-caddy-1  the shared gateway for *.genuinebasil.dev (repo genuinebnt/genuine.dev, its Caddyfile)
     │ edge network: anneal.{$DOMAIN} → reverse_proxy anneal-app:8787 (TLS by Caddy, behind Cloudflare)
  anneal stack (deploy/compose.prod.yml, project "anneal", checkout at ~/anneal)
     ├─ anneal-app   API + built web app + rust-analyzer; talks to the host Docker daemon via the socket
     │     └─ starts sandbox containers from anneal-runner:<sha> (--network none, read-only, unprivileged)
     └─ postgres     postgres:18-alpine, volume anneal_pgdata
```

- **Images** are built in CI, never on the VM (a release build would starve the other sites of memory).
  Dependencies are cached with cargo-chef and the GitHub Actions cache, so a code-only change rebuilds quickly.
- **The deploy key** in the `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` secret is a dedicated key, not anyone's personal one. On the VM,
  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` pins it to `command="/home/deploy/anneal/deploy/ssh-deploy.sh",restrict`, so all it can
  do is deploy a commit. `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS` pins the VM's host keys; `DEPLOY_HOST` is its address.
- **Registry access:** the deploy job pipes its short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `deploy.sh`, which logs in to ghcr.io,
  pulls, and logs out. Nothing long-lived is stored on the VM, and it works whether the packages are public or not.
- **Secrets on the VM** live in `~/anneal/deploy/.env` (mode 600, git-ignored; template `deploy/.env.example`):
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `ANNEAL_PASSPHRASE_HASH`, `DOCKER_GID`, `DEPLOY_UID`, `DEPLOY_GID`. The repo is public, so
  they must never be committed.
- **Sandbox paths:** the runner bind-mounts work directories into sandbox containers, and the host's daemon resolves
  those paths. So the work root is `/srv/anneal/work` both inside the app container and on the host.
  `/srv/anneal/cargo` (crate downloads for rust-analyzer) and `/srv/anneal/home` persist across deploys.
- **Disk hygiene:** `deploy.sh` removes dangling layers and every anneal image except the deployed one after each
  deploy. Container logs use Docker's `local` driver (5 × 10 MB, compressed) instead of the unbounded default.
- **Caching:** the app sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for `/assets/*` (content-hashed
  by Vite, so browsers and Cloudflare never re-ask) and `no-cache` for pages, so a deploy shows up on the next load.
  A missing asset is a 404, never the SPA fallback.
- **Host tuning:** `vm.swappiness = 10` (`/etc/sysctl.d/60-swappiness.conf`), so idle memory isn't swapped out while
  RAM is free.

## Keeping progress safe

Progress (attempts, runs, reviews, drafts, focus time, scratch) lives in the `anneal_pgdata` volume, which deploys
never touch: only the app container is replaced. Streaks and the activity calendar come from solve dates, so they
survive any content change. Per-problem progress is keyed by problem id, so three guards protect it:

1. **Renames carry history.** A problem lists its earlier ids in `renamed_from`; at startup the API moves every
   row stored under an old id to the current one (`preflight::apply_renames`, idempotent).
2. **CI** (`tools/check-progress-safety.py`) fails a push that removes a problem id without a `renamed_from`, or
   edits or deletes an applied migration.
3. **The deploy** backs up the database, then runs `anneal-api preflight` with the *new* image against the live
   database, before anything is replaced. If any stored progress would have no problem, or an applied migration
   changed, the deploy stops and the running version keeps serving.

**Backups:** `deploy/backup.sh` writes `pg_dump -Fc` files to `/srv/anneal/backups` before every deploy and daily
at 03:30 UTC (cron), keeping the newest 30. They're on the same VM, so they protect against bad deploys and
mistakes, not the VM's loss; for that, turn on Hetzner's server backups. To restore:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose.prod.yml --env-file deploy/.env exec -T postgres \
  pg_restore -U anneal -d anneal --clean --if-exists < /srv/anneal/backups/<file>.dump
```

## Everyday operations (on the VM, in `~/anneal`)

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose.prod.yml --env-file deploy/.env ps          # status
docker compose -f deploy/compose.prod.yml --env-file deploy/.env logs -f app # logs
deploy/deploy.sh                    # redeploy the latest images by hand (needs `docker login ghcr.io` if private)
deploy/deploy.sh <sha>              # roll back or forward to a specific commit's images
```

If the new app isn't healthy within 3 minutes, `up --wait` fails and so does the workflow run. Compose has already
replaced the old container by then, so roll back with `deploy/deploy.sh <previous sha>` (the image of the last good
commit is kept until the next successful deploy's cleanup).

## One-time setup (done 2026-09-28)

1. DNS: a Cloudflare record `anneal` → `46.224.108.227`, proxied like the other subdomains.
2. Gateway: the `anneal.{$DOMAIN}` block in genuinebnt/genuine.dev's Caddyfile, applied with
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart caddy` in `~/genuine.dev`. A restart rather than a reload,
   because the Caddyfile is a single-file bind mount that keeps pointing at the old file after `git pull`.
3. VM: `git clone https://github.com/genuinebnt/learn-rust.git ~/anneal`, `/srv/anneal/{work,cargo,home}` owned by
   deploy, and `deploy/.env` filled in.
4. Passphrase (prompts locally; only the argon2 hash leaves your machine):

   ```sh
   cargo run -q -p anneal-cli -- passphrase |
     ssh deploy@46.224.108.227 "sed -i '/^ANNEAL_PASSPHRASE_HASH=/d' ~/anneal/deploy/.env && cat >> ~/anneal/deploy/.env"
   ```

   then redeploy (re-run the latest workflow, or `deploy/deploy.sh` on the VM).
5. GitHub secrets `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`, `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS`, `DEPLOY_HOST`, and the authorized_keys line above.

The same VM used to run Marginal; it was shut down on 2026-09-28 (containers, images and volumes removed) and its
host now redirects to its project page.
