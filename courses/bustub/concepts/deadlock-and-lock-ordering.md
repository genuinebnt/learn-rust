title: Deadlock, lock ordering and holding a lock while you wait
summary: The four conditions of a deadlock, how page latches plus a pool lock produce one, the flush bug the stages teach, and the rules (order, short sections, never wait while holding) that remove it.

A **deadlock** is a set of threads each holding something another needs and waiting for something another holds. The system is not slow or busy; it is stopped, and no timeout or error will say why. The buffer pool has exactly the ingredients (a global lock, per-page latches, a blocking disk wait), and the last stage of module 1g is about a bug where they combine.

## The four conditions (Coffman, 1971)

A deadlock needs **all four**; remove any one and it cannot happen:

1. **Mutual exclusion**: a resource is held by one thread at a time (a mutex, a write latch).
2. **Hold and wait**: a thread holds one resource while waiting for another.
3. **No preemption**: a resource cannot be taken away; its holder must release it.
4. **Circular wait**: there is a cycle of threads, each waiting for the next one's resource.

You cannot remove (1) or (3) for locks. The practical levers are (2) *do not wait while holding* and (4) *impose a global order so no cycle can form*.

## The flush bug

```text
thread A: holds the WRITE latch of page 7 (a WritePageGuard) and asks the pool for another page: it needs the pool lock
thread B: flush_page(7):  takes the POOL lock, then waits for page 7's read latch to copy the bytes
```

A holds the page latch and needs the pool lock. B holds the pool lock and needs the page latch. Neither can proceed: a cycle. It needs only one writer and one flusher on the same page, so it passes every single-threaded test and appears under load.

```svg
caption: Thread A holds page 7's write latch and waits for the pool lock; thread B holds the pool lock and waits for page 7's latch. The arrows form a cycle, so neither can ever continue. Pinning first and releasing the pool lock breaks the cycle.

```

## The fix: do not hold the pool lock while waiting for the latch

```rust
let frame = {
    let mut inner = self.inner.lock().unwrap();                 // pool lock
    let Some(&frame) = inner.page_table.get(&page_id) else { return false };
    inner.meta[frame.0].pin_count += 1;                         // PIN the page: it cannot be evicted now
    inner.replacer.set_evictable(frame, false);
    frame
};                                                              // pool lock released HERE
let copy = /* wait for the frame's read latch, copy the bytes */;
self.write_page_data(page_id, &copy);
self.unpin_page(page_id, false);                                // pool lock again, briefly
```

The **pin** stands in for the lock: it promises the frame will not be reused, so the pool lock can be released *before* the potentially long wait for the latch. That removes "hold and wait" for the pair (pool lock, page latch).

## Rules that prevent deadlock

| rule | removes | example here |
|---|---|---|
| **a fixed lock order** (pool lock before page latch, parent page before child, left before right) | circular wait | a thread never takes the pool lock while holding a page latch it then waits on |
| **never block while holding a lock someone else needs** (disk I/O, another lock, a channel `get`) | hold and wait | release the pool lock before waiting for the latch |
| **keep critical sections short** and lexically scoped (a guard's lifetime) | makes both easier to see | `{ let mut inner = lock(); ...; }` |
| **try-lock and back off** | hold and wait (by giving up) | `try_write()` and retry |
| **a timeout that reports** | detection, not prevention | the stage tests wait on futures with a deadline and fail with a message |

> [!TIP] Finding one
> A hung test is a deadlock until proven otherwise. On macOS or Linux, `sample <pid>` / `gdb -p <pid> -batch -ex "thread apply all bt"` prints every thread's stack; look for two threads each inside `lock()` or `read()`/`write()`, and read the frames above to see what each already holds.

## Deadlock detection (a preview)

Module 4's lock manager cannot always order its locks (transactions choose their own), so it **detects** deadlocks instead: build a *waits-for graph* (an edge from each waiting transaction to the one holding what it wants) and abort a transaction on a cycle. The same four conditions, a different lever.

## In real code

### The API you will use

| tool | what it does | when |
|---|---|---|
| `m.try_lock()` / `l.try_read()` / `try_write()` | never waits: `Err(WouldBlock)` | back off instead of deadlocking |
| `cv.wait_timeout(..)` / `rx.recv_timeout(d)` / `handle.join()` + a watchdog thread | a deadline on a wait | turn a hang into a failure |
| `std::ptr::eq(a, b)` / `Arc::as_ptr(&a)` | a stable address to order locks by | a total order over *any* pair of locks |
| a fixed acquisition order (documented) | the actual fix | always |
| `drop(guard)` / an inner `{ .. }` block | release before waiting | "do not wait while holding" |
| `gdb -p <pid> -batch -ex "thread apply all bt"` / `sample <pid>` (macOS) | stacks of every thread | diagnosing a live hang |

```rust test
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

/// Always lock the lower address first, so two threads taking the same pair in opposite argument order cannot deadlock.
fn lock_both<'a, T>(a: &'a Mutex<T>, b: &'a Mutex<T>) -> (std::sync::MutexGuard<'a, T>, std::sync::MutexGuard<'a, T>) {
    if (a as *const _ as usize) < (b as *const _ as usize) {
        let ga = a.lock().unwrap();
        let gb = b.lock().unwrap();
        (ga, gb)
    } else {
        let gb = b.lock().unwrap();
        let ga = a.lock().unwrap();
        (ga, gb)
    }
}

#[test]
fn opposite_argument_order_same_lock_order() {
    let x = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let y = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|| for _ in 0..2000 { let (mut a, mut b) = lock_both(&x, &y); *a += 1; *b += 1; });
        s.spawn(|| for _ in 0..2000 { let (mut b, mut a) = lock_both(&y, &x); *a += 1; *b += 1; });   // asks in the other order
    });
    assert_eq!((*x.lock().unwrap(), *y.lock().unwrap()), (4000, 4000));
}

#[test]
fn try_lock_and_back_off() {
    let a = Mutex::new(1);
    let b = Mutex::new(2);
    let ga = a.lock().unwrap();
    let got = loop {
        match b.try_lock() {
            Ok(gb) => break Some(*gb),                           // got the second lock: proceed
            Err(_) => { drop(ga); break None; }                  // could not: release what we hold and retry later (no hold-and-wait)
        }
    };
    assert_eq!(got, Some(2));
}
```

```rust test
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

#[test]
fn a_watchdog_turns_a_deadlock_into_a_failure() {
    let (done_tx, done_rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let m = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let m2 = Arc::clone(&m);
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let _g = m2.lock().unwrap();
        done_tx.send(()).unwrap();                               // pretend the real work finished
    });
    done_rx.recv_timeout(Duration::from_secs(2)).expect("the worker is stuck: a deadlock?");   // a hang becomes a failing test with a message
}
```

### In the exercises

- **1g-02:** reproduce the flush deadlock (a writer holding a page latch while another thread, holding the pool lock, waits for it) with a test that has a watchdog (third example), then fix `flush_page`: pin under the pool lock, release the lock, *then* wait for the page latch. The first example is the general-purpose fix; yours removes hold-and-wait.
- **1g-01:** release order inside a guard (unlatch, then unpin) is a lock-ordering rule: never hold a pin without the right to the latch, never the reverse.
- **2b-08 and 2b-11:** a fixed order of page latches (header, directory, bucket; lower slot first for two buckets).

### Where it is used

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL documents a lock-ordering hierarchy for its lightweight locks; MySQL/InnoDB detect row-lock deadlocks with a waits-for graph and abort a victim (module 4).
- **Operating systems**: Linux's `lockdep` records the order of every lock acquisition and warns on a possible cycle *before* it ever deadlocks.
- **Application code**: the classic bank-transfer problem (lock both accounts in id order).
- **Tooling**: Rust has `parking_lot`'s `deadlock` feature and `loom` to explore interleavings; Java has `jstack` deadlock detection.
