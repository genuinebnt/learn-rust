//! What the write-ahead log says, one record at a time.
//!
//! A record is a transaction beginning, a **change** of one record slot (its state before and after: `None` means the slot holds no live
//! record), a commit, an abort (written once a rollback has been logged to the end) or a checkpoint. The byte format is yours: the tests
//! only need `deserialize(serialize(r))` to give `r` back, and a damaged or cut-off record to be recognised as such.
