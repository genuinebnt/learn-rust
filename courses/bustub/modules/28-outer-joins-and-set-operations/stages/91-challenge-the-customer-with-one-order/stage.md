A challenge: no walkthrough, no hints, no solution. It is extra practice and does not count towards the course.

## What to fix

`partner_counts` in `src/execution/outer_join_counts.rs` answers the report "for every customer (left row), how many orders (right rows) have the same key?" as `select a.id, count(...) from a left join b on a.k = b.k group by a.id`. It uses the right outer join, so customers without orders are listed, and the report shows them with the wrong number. Find the bug and fix it.

## Why

The report is the reason outer joins exist, and the wrong number is the most common bug written with them. After a LEFT join a customer with no orders is one row whose order columns are NULL. `count(*)` counts rows, so it says 1; `count(b.id)` counts non-NULL values, so it says 0. Nothing crashes and every customer with at least one order is right, which is why the bug survives review.

## The contract

- One `(payload, count)` per left row, in the order of the left rows. A left row's count is the number of right rows with an equal key.
- A NULL key has no partners: its count is 0, and it is still listed.
- The right payload is never read for its value, only for its presence.

## Invariants

These must hold after every step, whatever the input:

- Every left row is listed exactly once, whatever its count.
- The counts add up to the number of matching pairs of the inner join.

## Relations between input and output

How the answer must change when the input changes. The property tests check these on random inputs:

- Adding a right row with a key no left row has changes nothing.
- Adding a right row with the key of a left row raises that row's count by one and no other.

## Examples

Worked cases (the tests include them):

```text
left [(1, id 10), (2, id 20)], right [(1, a), (1, b)] -> (10, 2) (20, 0)
left [(NULL, id 30)], right [(NULL, a)] -> (30, 0)
```

## What the tests check

- Customers without orders have count 0.
- Customers with several orders.
- NULL keys.
- The invariants and relations on random inputs.

## Done when

All the `s3j_c2` tests pass, and you can say in one sentence what the bug was.
