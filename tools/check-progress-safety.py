"""Fails when a change would lose someone's progress. CI runs it against the previous commit (or a PR's base):

    python3 tools/check-progress-safety.py <base-rev>

1. Every problem id at <base-rev> must still exist, be listed in some problem's `renamed_from`, or be listed in
   `content/retired.txt` (removed on purpose; its progress is deleted at startup). Progress is stored by id
   (`<track code>-<slug>`, or `lc-<slug>` for the DSA lists), so a renamed, moved or deleted problem would otherwise
   vanish from every dashboard.
2. Migrations are append-only: editing or deleting an applied one makes the API refuse to start.

The deploy runs the stronger check too (`anneal-api preflight` against the live database), so this is the early
warning, not the only one.
