//! Port of `src/storage/index/index_iterator.cpp`: a range scan over the leaves of a B+ tree. It remembers a position (a leaf page
//! and a slot in it) and, when asked for the next pair, latches the leaf just long enough to copy the pair out. Nothing stays
//! latched between calls, so a scan never blocks writers for longer than one read (the price: a scan that races with a writer may
//! see the tree change under it, which BusTub's own iterator allows too).
//!
//! BusTub's iterator is a C++ iterator (`*it`, `++it`, `it != tree.End()`); Rust's is the `Iterator` trait (`for (k, v) in tree.begin()`),
//! and [`IndexIterator::is_end`] and `==` are there for the tests that spell it the C++ way. How the iterator is built, and what the tree
//! hands it, is yours.
